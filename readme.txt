This plugin will let you create custom post relationships among posts, pages and custom post types.

== Description ==

Most of the "related posts" plugins out there while they provide some kind of control on how to create related posts, they all rely on an algorithm 
and the results are automatic. With CPTR you get total control as you can manually select the posts that you want to relate.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. In the Posts page you will see the main screen of the plugin.
